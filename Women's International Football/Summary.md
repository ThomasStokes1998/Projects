# Summary
This project uses the results of every women's international football match -that was not a friendly- from November 1967 to June 2020, to look at how playing at home and a teams 
experience affects their performance (i.e. how often they win and how many goals they score per game). The data set I used was from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets. I decided
to analyse this dataset specifically because women's football is a sport I do not know alot about. So I thought it would be interesting to see what an outsider could learn about
the sport only using data analysis tools. \
Findings:
* Playing at home means a team is 14% more likely to win and 16% less likely to lose on average
* Playing at home does not have a statistically significant effect on how often a team draws
* Playing at home equates to about 0.2 extra goals per game
* Experience is directly correlated with more wins and fewer losses
