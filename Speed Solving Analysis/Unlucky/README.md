# Near Misses

For every WCA event that has an average WR here are all the averages that could have got the WR average but didn't on the last solve.

For 333fm the move count needed is 15, to exclude attempts that have no reasonable chance of ending up in breaking the WR average. 

"unlucky event.csv" contains all the competitors with at least one missed WR. \
"unlucky event breakdown.csv" contains all the averages as well as what they needed to get the WR average.
