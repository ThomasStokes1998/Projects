# What is Speed Solving?

The goal of speed solving is to solve the Rubik's Cube (and similar puzzles) as fast as possible. Most speed solvers are able to do this in under 20 seconds. There is an
organisation called the World Cube Association (WCA) which organises competitions in which speed solvers can compete and get official times that are posted on leaderboards.
I am a speed solver myself, and I have also been to a couple of competitions organised by the WCA. 

The WCA has a website where they show competitions (both upcoming and past ones) as well as leaderboards for the various events that are speed solved at competitions. The data for
the leaderboards is also freely able to be downloaded from their website: https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/export.html. 

# Summary

In this repository I have some of the projects I have done related to Rubik's Cubes. This includes statistics I have generated using the WCA database as well as
programs for solving Rubik's Cubes and similar puzzles.

Have a look at the 'WCA Statistics FB Group' folder for examples of statistics I have generated using the database along with the source code for some of them.

In this folder there are examples of Python scripts I have written to do with Rubik's Cubes. Below is a brief description of the files:
* RubiksCube.py - A class that simulates a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. Note some features such as solvers will not work without external files.
* RubiksCube2.py - A class that simulates a 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube.
* blind.py - Uses the RubiksCube.py file to find letters used in memorisation for blind folded solving.
