# What is Speed Solving?
The goal of speed solving is to solve the Rubik's Cube (and similiar puzzles) as fast as possible. Most speed solvers are able to do this in under 20 seconds. There is an
organisation called the World Cube Association (WCA) which organises competitions in which speed solvers can compete and get official times that are posted on leaderboards.
I am a speed solver myself, and I have also been to a couple of competitions organised by the WCA. 

The WCA has a website where they show competitions (both upcoming and past ones) as well as leaderboards for the various events that are speed solved at competitions. The data for
the leaderboards is also freely able to be downloaded from their website: https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/export.html. 
# Summary
Obviously, since I am a speed solver myself (and on the database) I am personally interested this dataset.  I have posted a copy of the dataset in the WCA Database folder, the WCA
itself updates the database daily, however since competitions tend to only happen on weekends, my version may be a couple of days behind the official database. The WCA Database 
folder has a README.md file produced by the WCA that gives the proper credits for the database, outlines how the database can be used and republished and explains specifically what
the dataset contains. 

I am interested in answering the following questions:
* How fast are competitors improving? 
* Is the rate of improvement speeding up, slowing down, remaining constant? 

As well as adding the following features:
* A relay leaderboard
* A scoring system
