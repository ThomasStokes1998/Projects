# Summary
Using the well known data set of handwritten digits from MNIST. I built a convolution neural network (CNN) to classify the images. The CNN was done for a Kaggle competition
involving the dataset. The competition can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer. I decided to enter this competition so that I could teach myself how to
code neural networks using TensorFlow. Before entering this competition, I understood the maths behind neural networks -including the convolution layers- (from my maths degree).
* CNN accuracy: 98.6%
